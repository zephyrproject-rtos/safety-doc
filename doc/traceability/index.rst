Traceability
#############

Traceability is a key aspect of software development, ensuring that all requirements are met and validated through testing. In Zephyr, we maintain traceability between requirements, architecture specifications, and test cases.
This document outlines the traceability relationships within Zephyr, including:

- Requirements to test case traceability
- Test case to requirements traceability
- Requirements to architecture specification traceability
